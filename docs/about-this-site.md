## What is a good point of this site for "me" ?

### Almost Free
The cost of this site is...
- Google Domain(https://www.coderhackers.com) 13usd/year
- Google Cloud Storage ($0.010/month)

### Nice design
Thanks to [docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io), I don't need to tackle css in **"document"** and **"blog"**.

Although I need to customize the top page design, the default **"blog"** and **"document"** design is perfect for me.

### Edit everywhere
I can edit document and blog from ...
- Local editor (VS code)
- Browser editor ([StackEdit](https://github.com/benweet/stackedit)) and this is wysiwyg editor!
