```html title="flexbox-test.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
      .container {
        background-color: violet;
        padding: 20px;
        height: 800px;
      }

      .item {
        background-color: orange;
        width: 300px;
        height: 300px;
        color: white;
        border: 1px solid #000000;
        font-size: 32px;
        margin: 10px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="item">1</div>
      <div class="item">2</div>
