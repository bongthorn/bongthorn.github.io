Congratulation! You've completed the entire curriculum of this course!

## What we've learned in this course

We've learned the following knowledge in this course

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap
5. jQuery

We've gained the knowledge to create a cool and interactive website and deployed the website for everyone to access!

## Jobs you can do with your current skills
With your current skills, you can take on jobs such as

- Creating and revamping company landing pages.
- As a junior front-end engineer, create and modify pages that are not related to the backend (such as About page and How to page).

## What should you learn next?

Front-end alone cannot meet the following specifications for web services

- Storing data permanently
- Log in and log out
- Send an email to users
- Building a Payment System

And so on...

In order to achieve these requirements, you will need to learn about **Back-end**.

There are a number of options for developing the back-end of your website.

:::info  Backend Language + Web Framework
- Ruby + Ruby on Rails
- Javascript (Node.js) + Express
- PHP + Laravel
- Python + Django
:::

Which one to choose is a very difficult question to answer.

But I would recommend **Ruby + Ruby on Rails**.

I first tried (Node.js + Express), but at the time it was too difficult for me and I gave up on it.

After that, I tried **Ruby on Rails** and I was able to create a web service quickly and it was a lot of fun for me.

I'm currently working on the Ruby on Rails course and hope to see you again at some point.

See you~! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
