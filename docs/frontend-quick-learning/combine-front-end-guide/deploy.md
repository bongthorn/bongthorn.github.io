### Install Node

You will need **Node** to download the vercel command line tool, so install it first.

First, **check to see if node and npm are already installed.**

Type the following command in terminal. **If you see the version, it's already installed.**

```sh
node -v
# highlight-next-line
v10.10.0
npm -v
# highlight-next-line
6.4.1
```
**If you don't have node and npm installed**, please click the link below to install the LTS version.

When you install node, npm is installed at the same time.
