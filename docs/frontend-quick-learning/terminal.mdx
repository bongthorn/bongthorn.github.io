## What is Terminal?

> The Mac Terminal is a <mark>**command line interface (CLI)**</mark> for Mac OS X available in all OS X versions through Lion. It is also a gateway to Unix, or the underlying operating system of OS X. Terminal allows users to modify various characteristics of their Mac desktops, fonts, files and <mark>**more beyond the standard OS X graphical user interface (GUI).**</mark> It allows for total customization and command. However, if novice computer users apply modifications incorrectly, this can harm the system or lead to a loss of data.

## GUI vs CLI

Okay, so let's do the same thing with both **GUI** and **CLI**.

### GUI

1. Make `test-gui` folder inside `desktop`
2. Create new file `text.txt` inside `test-gui`
3. Open `test-gui` folder in VS code

### CLI

1. Make `test-cli` folder inside `desktop`
2. Create new file `text.txt` inside `test-cli`
3. Open `test-cli` folder in VS code

<Tabs
  groupId="operating-systems"
  defaultValue="win"
  values={[
    { label: "Windows terminal with Powershell", value: "win" },
    { label: "mac terminal", value: "mac" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="win">

```powershell title="terminal"
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir test-cli
cd test-cli
ni -Path . -Name "text.txt" # not recommend
code .
```

:::tip I don't recommend to create file with Powershell

- Powershell has complicated encoding system.
- This will cause a super annoying bug.
- So, I recommend you to create file inside VS code.
